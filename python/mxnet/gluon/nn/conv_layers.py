    """Abstract nD convolution layer (private, used as implementation base).

    This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved
    with the layer input to produce a tensor of outputs.
    If `use_bias` is `True`, a bias vector is created and added to the outputs.
    Finally, if `activation` is not `None`,
    it is applied to the outputs as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    channels : int
        The dimensionality of the output space
        i.e. the number of output channels in the convolution.
    kernel_size : int or tuple/list of n ints
        Specifies the dimensions of the convolution window.
    strides: int or tuple/list of n ints,
        Specifies the strides of the convolution.
    padding : int or tuple/list of n ints,
        If padding is non-zero, then the input is implicitly zero-padded
        on both sides for padding number of points
    dilation: int or tuple/list of n ints,
        Specifies the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.
    groups : int
        Controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
        At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two convolution
        layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels, and producing
        half the output channels, and both subsequently concatenated.
    layout : str,
        Dimension ordering of data and weight. Can be 'NCW', 'NWC', 'NCHW',
        'NHWC', 'NCDHW', 'NDHWC', etc. 'N', 'C', 'H', 'W', 'D' stands for
        batch, channel, height, width and depth dimensions respectively.
        Convolution is performed over 'D', 'H', and 'W' dimensions.
    in_channels : int, default 0
        The number of input channels to this layer. If not specified,
        initialization will be deferred to the first time `forward` is called
        and `in_channels` will be inferred from the shape of input data.
    activation : str
        Activation function to use. See :func:`~mxnet.ndarray.Activation`.
        If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
        (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
    use_bias: bool
        Whether the layer uses a bias vector.
    weight_initializer : str or `Initializer`
        Initializer for the `weight` weights matrix.
    bias_initializer: str or `Initializer`
        Initializer for the bias vector.

    dilation : int or tuple/list of 1 int
        Controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the

    groups : int
        Controls the connections between inputs and outputs.

    Parameters
    ----------

        channels (filters) in the convolution.
    kernel_size :int or tuple/list of 2 int
        Specifies the dimensions of the convolution window.
    strides : int or tuple/list of 2 int
        Specify the strides of the convolution.
    padding : int or a tuple/list of 2 int,

        Controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the
        a trous algorithm
    groups : int
        Controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
