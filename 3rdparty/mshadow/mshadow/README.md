Code Guide
====
This readme contains notes about code in mshadow. MShadow generally follows Google's C++ Style.

Convention
====
* Basically, all the files ends in ```-inl.h, -inl.cuh``` are implementations, and can be ignored if only using mshadow
* The files ends in ```.h``` are heavily commented with [doxyen format](http://www.doxygen.org/), and can be used to generate the corresponding document.
