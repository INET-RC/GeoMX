Klonet-based Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Klonet is a network emulation platform for the technology innovation. It
is designed to support the development and testing of new network
protocols and applications in a realistic environment. Klonet can
emulate various network scenarios, such as wireless, mobile, satellite,
and optical networks, and provide fine-grained control over the network
parameters, such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss. Klonet
can also integrate with real devices and applications, such as routers,
switches, sensors, and smartphones, to create hybrid network
experiments. Klonet is based on the Linux operating system and uses
virtualization and containerization technologies to create isolated
network nodes and links. Klonet also provides a graphical user interface
and a command-line interface for users to configure and manage their
network experiments.
