"Klonet is a network emulation platform for the technology innovation. It "
"is designed to support the development and testing of new network "
"protocols and applications in a realistic environment. Klonet can emulate"
" various network scenarios, such as wireless, mobile, satellite, and "
"optical networks, and provide fine-grained control over the network "
"parameters, such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss. Klonet can"
" also integrate with real devices and applications, such as routers, "
"switches, sensors, and smartphones, to create hybrid network experiments."
" Klonet is based on the Linux operating system and uses virtualization "
"and containerization technologies to create isolated network nodes and "
"links. Klonet also provides a graphical user interface and a command-line"
" interface for users to configure and manage their network experiments."
