## How Examples are Organized

Examples of 4 communication algorithms are based on `Convolutional Neural Networks` while examples of other machine learning algorithms are based on `Fully-synchronous Algorithm`. Please pay attention to the fact that due to different algorithm design motivations and some limitations of code-level implementation, except for the commonly used Fully-synchronous Algorithm, other communication algorithms may not be fully compatible with each of the machine learning algorithms or communication-efficient strategies. Additionally, only algorithms related with gradient descent will work with `BSC`. Please use with caution.
